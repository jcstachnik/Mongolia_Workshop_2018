After cross correlation, make the corrections to the dt.cc file using the 
awk line: 

These lines can be put in a Python terminal or run as a script.  
The cross correlations can take hours to run, depending on the 
size of the project.  I like to run them using a command like 
this:

nohup time python ./run_deren.py >& deren.log &

The 'nohup' command allows the command to continue running 
even if the terminal window is closed.
The 'time' command just keeps track of how long it takes
for a command to run. 

Then the output is redirected into a log file called deren.log.

Bon chance.
